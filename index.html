    <p>My Artist Statement</p>
        <p>When creating art I do not like to use too much color, most times I will just leave the art piece in greyscale because I believe it looks a bit better that way. If there is a certain mood I want to set I will study the piece before applying the right assets. In my art I like to make small marks because I like to use a lot of detailing. I find blending to be very useful. Instead of just laying down colors and letting them blend on their own, it feels nice to have full control of the way it works. It also helps to get rid of any visible marks that you didn’t get rid of the first time. I'd like to say that my art style is very chaotic and abstract because sometimes I don’t plan what I’m about to create. I do prefer working with more text rather than anything else, such as graffiti art or calligraphy. Sometimes there will be occasions where I will draw an original character or a landscape but I prefer more text based art. Making things for my peers or for someone special they will view my art style and describe it as very much like a dark webcomic but also very pretty or pleasing to look at. My Imagery tends to be a bit more on the dark side. I do love creating dark fantasy art. I will use a photograph as a reference or just make a sketch with no thumbnails or planning. If I’m feeling inspired then I will grab the necessary materials and just begin creating, there is no specific technique, which is why I say it’s rather chaotic.
            I create what I create because it gives me a sense of power and peace, I have complete and total creative control over the situation. I don’t have to follow any specific rules. I don’t like being told how to make things nor do I like to follow any guidelines, I personally feel as though if you are given a set of rules to follow than it completely defeats the whole creative process, a concept is all that should be given to an artist to allow them to expose themselves and show their true potential.I believe my art can give you a look at what my mind is like, I am heavily by my peers and anything that has to do with anything dark, mysterious and or disturbing and I like to portray these things into my creations because it looks intense and makes people think.</p>
